So what about Non-Functional Requirements? What are those, and how are they different?
Simply put, the difference is that non-functional requirements describe how the system works, 
while functional requirements describe what the system should do.
The definition for a non-functional requirement is that it essentially specifies how the system should behave and that it is a constraint upon the systems behaviour.
One could also think of non-functional requirements as quality attributes for of a system.


Some typical non-functional requirements are:

Performance – for example Response Time, Throughput, Utilization, Static Volumetric
Scalability
Capacity
Availability
Reliability
Recoverability
Maintainability
Serviceability
Security
Regulatory
Manageability
Environmental
Data Integrity
